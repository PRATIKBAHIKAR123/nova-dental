                <AccordionContent className='faq-ans'>
                  <p>A dental crown is a fitted cap that covers dental implants or individual teeth. You may be a candidate for a dental crown if you have any of the following:</p>
                  <ul className='list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2'>
                    <li>Decayed teeth</li>
                    <li>Broken teeth</li>
                    <li>Oversized cavity</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className='mt-3'>You may also need a crown if you grind your teeth. Crowns restore function and prevent further decay. Materials include porcelain, ceramic, or metal like gold.</p>

                <AccordionTrigger className='faq-qn'>What are dental bridges?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className='faq-ans'>
                  <p>A dental bridge replaces one or more missing teeth by connecting an artificial tooth to surrounding teeth or implants. This prevents surrounding teeth from shifting and maintains alignment.</p>
                  <p className='mt-3'>Bridges are typically made of porcelain or a mix of porcelain and metal to resemble natural teeth.</p>

              <AccordionItem value='q3'>
                <AccordionTrigger className='faq-qn'>What is the process for getting a dental crown?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className='faq-ans'>
                  <p>First, a dental impression is taken. Then, the affected tooth is filed down and the crown is secured with dental cement. The dentist checks your bite and makes final adjustments to ensure comfort.</p>

              </AccordionItem>

              <AccordionItem value='q4'>
                <AccordionTrigger className='faq-qn'>What is the process for getting a dental bridge?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className='faq-ans'>
                  <p>The process usually involves two or three appointments. After crowns are placed on adjacent teeth, impressions are taken to ensure the bridge fits perfectly. A follow-up ensures the restoration is successful.</p>
                  <p className='mt-3'>To schedule a consultation about crowns or bridges, call Maple Dental or use the online booking tool.</p>
