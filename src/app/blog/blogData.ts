  <p>If you've ever felt a sharp ache in the back of your mouth or noticed swelling in your gums, you might be facing an unwelcome guest: wisdom teeth. Usually, these third molars erupt between the ages of 17 and 25. Sometimes, they grow without issue. But often, they become problematic – and when that happens, removal becomes necessary.</p>

<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding the Importance of Root Canals</h3>
  <p>Let's be real—no one's ever excited about needing a root canal. But when the pulp inside your tooth becomes inflamed or infected, delaying treatment can lead to pain, abscesses, and even tooth loss. A root canal removes the infected tissue and saves your natural tooth, avoiding the need for extraction.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Root Canal Treatment Process at Maple Dental, NJ</h3>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Thorough Examination and Diagnosis:</strong> The process always starts with a detailed dental exam. Using advanced digital X-rays and diagnostic tools, your dentist will assess the health of your tooth and identify the extent of the infection or damage. You'll also be walked through your treatment options so you understand what to expect.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Anesthesia:</strong> Worried about pain? Don't be. To keep you comfortable, we gently numb the area so the procedure feels pain-free. Most people say they feel some pressure during the procedure, but not actual pain.</li>
    <li><strong>Removing the Infected Pulp:</strong> Once you're settled in, the dentist gently opens the top of the tooth to reach the problem area inside. Then, using precision tools, the damaged tissue is removed and the canals are cleaned to stop the infection from coming back.</li>
    <li><strong>Shaping and Disinfection:</strong> The canals are then carefully shaped and disinfected. We use cutting-edge rotary tools and antimicrobial solutions to make sure every bit of bacteria is removed, which is essential for long-term success.</li>
    <li><strong>Filling the Canals:</strong> Once the tooth is thoroughly cleaned, the canals are filled with gutta-percha, a reliable, biocompatible material that helps keep the tooth stable.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary or Permanent Restoration:</strong> To protect the tooth in the meantime, a temporary filling is placed until the permanent solution is ready. Often, a custom crown is placed later to restore the tooth's full strength and function. We offer same-day crown options in some cases, depending on the condition of the tooth.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you are exploring your dentistry options, there are many attributes to consider when choosing the best practice for you: location, ratings, and treatment options. You should also review the type of practice you want, either a chain, corporate office or a local, private practice. While there are some benefits to choosing a corporate dentist, today we will detail the many reasons why you should trust a local dentist.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Choose a Local Dentist?</h3>
  <p>A local practice provides continuity in the staff and dentists treating you, rather than at a corporate office, where it is unusual to see the same dentist at each of your appointments. Because you will be familiar with your dentist at a local practice, you will be better able to trust your dentist and their decisions. Your dentist will also know you, your history, and your needs better than a corporate dentist, therefore providing more personalized and attentive care.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-8">
  <p>Additionally, visiting a local dentist can alleviate dental anxiety, since seeing the same staff at each visit will enable you to anticipate what the visit will entail, allowing you to feel more comfortable and prepared. Local dentists also focus on creating a welcoming environment to enhance the patients’ relaxation, while corporate practices maintain a more businesslike atmosphere. Overall, you should consider choosing a local dentist, since they will provide great care and a personal approach, focusing on what is best for you!</p>

<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Qualifies as a Dental Emergency?</h3>
  <p>Not every dental issue is an emergency, but some require immediate attention. Below are examples of situations that are considered <a href="#">dental emergencies</a>:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Severe toothache</li>
    <li>Knocked-out tooth</li>
    <li>Cracked or broken teeth</li>
    <li>Lost filling or crown</li>
    <li>Abscesses or infections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you must seek emergency dental care immediately.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why You Shouldn’t Delay Treatment</h3>
  <p>When a dental emergency strikes, delaying treatment can worsen the problem. A minor issue, such as a small crack in a tooth, can become larger, leading to infection or even tooth loss if left untreated. Delaying your dental treatment could lead to more complicated and costly procedures.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Types of Dental Emergencies</h3>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Severe Toothache</strong><br/>A severe toothache can be caused by a number of things, such as an abscess, decay, or a damaged nerve. This type of pain should never be ignored as it might indicate a serious underlying condition.</li>
    <li><strong>Knocked-Out Tooth</strong><br/>The tooth should be reinserted within 30 minutes to an hour for the best chance of saving it. Keep the dislodged tooth in milk or saline solution as you head to your dentist.</li>
    <li><strong>Cracked or Broken Teeth</strong><br/>A cracked or broken tooth can expose sensitive nerves, leading to pain and further damage. Depending on the severity, a broken tooth may require anything from bonding to a root canal or crown.</li>
    <li><strong>Lost Filling or Crown</strong><br/>Temporary dental cement from a drugstore can help protect the tooth until you can see a dentist.</li>
    <li><strong>Abscesses and Infections</strong><br/>Symptoms include swelling, fever, and a constant, throbbing pain.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section class="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">QUICK Steps to Take in a Dental Emergency</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Toothache:</strong> Rinse your mouth with warm water, gently floss to remove debris, and apply a cold compress to the outside of your mouth to reduce swelling.</li>
    <li><strong>Knocked-Out Tooth:</strong> Handle the tooth by the crown, rinse it gently (without scrubbing), and place it back in the socket if possible. If that’s not possible, place it in milk or a saline solution and seek dental care promptly.</li>
    <li><strong>Broken Teeth or Lost Crowns:</strong> Rinse your mouth with warm water, use gauze to stop any bleeding, and apply a cold compress. For lost crowns, dental cement can provide temporary relief until you see your dentist.</li>

<section class="mb-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Screening and PPE</h3>
  <p>Patients are also required to fill out a questionnaire before their appointments, regarding possible exposure or symptoms. With this information, we can ask patients with fevers or who traveled internationally to reschedule in six weeks, if possible. In addition, every team member wears 3 levels of protection—an N95 mask, surgical mask, and face shield—to minimize chances of spread, as well as well as full body PPE gowns, gloves, goggles, and hair covers.
